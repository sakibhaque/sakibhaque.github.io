	<h1>Sakib Haque</h1>
	<p>
		I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Notre Dame in the department of Computer Science and Engineering.
		Advised by <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~cmc/">Collin McMillan</a>, I work in the intersection of software engineering and natural language processing with an emphasis on code comprehension.
		In particular, I apply deep learning models for automatic software documentation and neural source code summarization.
